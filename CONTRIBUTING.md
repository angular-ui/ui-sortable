# Contributing to UI Sortable

## Reporting Issues

The following examples are provided as a good starting point to demonstrate issues, proposals and use cases.
Feel free to edit any of them for your needs (don't forget to also update the libraries used to your version).

* [Simple Demo](http://codepen.io/thgreasi/pen/jlkhr)
* [Connected Lists](http://codepen.io/thgreasi/pen/uFile)

Since some issues may be caused by jquery-ui-sortable and not by the wrapping that angular-ui-sortable does,
please try your use case using [this plain jquery-ui sortable example](http://codepen.io/thgreasi/pen/rarQvR) before opening a new issue in the repositry.
